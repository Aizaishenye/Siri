# API key acquisition

To use the "shortcut" to call the ChatGPT API, an OpenAI API key is required. You can go to the OpenAI official website to get it for free, the steps are as follows:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com to register an account and log in
2. Click on the avatar in the upper right corner and select "View API keys"
3. Click the "Create new secret key" button on the right side of the page to generate an API key
4. Copy the API key for backup. Note that the API key only appears once. If you forgot it, regenerate a new


> Note: There is a fee to use the API, the price is $0.0020 / 1K tokens, 1k tokens is approximately equal to 750 words, or 500 Chinese characters. New users of OpenAI will have a credit of ¥18 for use. Therefore, it is best not to share the API key with others. If the API key is leaked, you can delete it in the OpenAI background and generate a new one.

# How to use

Start the "shortcut" with Siri, just say "Hey, Siri, ChatGPT", and then you can start chatting with Siri, our Siri has become very smart, enjoy! 🎉

If you don't like the name, you can rename the shortcut, change it to any name you like, and then you can chat with Siri just say "Hey, Siri, xxx", xxx is the new name you  chose, it's better not to add special symbols to the name. It’s hard to read the symbols 😂, If Siri cannot match the name of the shortcut, it won’t work!

Of course, you can also directly click the shortcut to use. At this time, it is used in the form of a dialog box, and it will not be read out. end 🎉
